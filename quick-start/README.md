I've made this script to help me start fast when I want to do some web development on my Linux machine.

It has 3 options:
1. To print current working directory
2. To list all the files and directories in your current directory
3. To create brand new directory for your project

If you choose third option, you just need to pick a name for a new directory (where your new project will be placed), and this
script is going to make that directory together with index.html (including base web page structure), main.css and main.js files.
When that's done, it will open newly created directory in Atom text editor. 

Enjoy!
